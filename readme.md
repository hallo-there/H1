Work in progress. There is **ZERO GARANTEE THAT THIS WILL WORK**
I have yet to try to assemble this printer

The H1 is a 3d printer designed to be made cheap, advanced, but easy to build features. The frame is built around 1-inch square steel tubes which currently are less than $10 for 36" at my local Menards. The design also uses M6 Bolts, M3 Heatset inserts, Printed parts (ABS/ASA), and a single lead screw with two linear rods harvested from my Anycubic Mega X. (Note; Probably need to add a linear rail or two to provide more rigidity)

The idea was to run Klipper from the start... TBD

The PSU is seperate and uses an XT60 connector because I can

As I continue, I intend to add more hardware support, such as multiple/different Z-axis systems and mainboard support

Todo:
* Gantry mount for 2020 extrusion and either square steel tube or bare linear bearing(s) #Feedback Appreciated
* More Z-axis options
* Build H1.0 for testing (yes, planning on doing Voron style serials hopefully
* Iterate
* Iterate
* Iterate some more
