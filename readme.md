Work in progress.
The H1 is a 3d printer designed to be made cheap, but contain advanced features and be easy to build.

The frame is made using one inch square tubes, M6 bolts, and 3d printed parts. I did this after realizing that the frame of a Voron (built with T-slot extrusions) can cost more than half the total price of the printer. 
From the start, I intended this printer to be a CoreXY that can be enclosed, meant to run Klipper firmware, cheap to build, and be easy to upgrade.
