Work in progress.
The H1 is a 3d printer designed to be made cheap, but contain advanced features. 
The frame is made using one inch square tubes, M6 bolts, and 3d printed parts. I did this after realizing that the frame of a Voron (built with T-slot extrusions) can cost more than half the total price of the printer. 
In the spirit of RepRap and Voron, I have decided to make this printer design fully open source, just short of being able to claim you made it. I hope a great community builds up around this design.
